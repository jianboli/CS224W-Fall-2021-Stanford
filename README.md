## Highlights

- Message passing in GraphML. *I think it is the most important conception in GNN. The ppts are very intuitive and concise which are quite worth reading*
- PyG. *In the Colabs, we will use this package quite often, not only at high-level but also at low-level. To finish the Colabs, you usually need to check the docs, which make you familiar with PyG*
- GCN/GAT/GraphSAGE *We will implement these models in the Colabs*
- PageRank, Knowledge graph, etc. *This course covers many topics in GNN.*
