  # Traditional Methods for Machine Learning in Graphs
  - 2.1 Traditional Feature-based Methods: Node [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IS7UhNMQ3U&list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn&index=4&t=1s&pp=iAQB)
    - Degree:
    - Centrality:
      - Eignvector centrality:
        - my centrality is a constant times the average centrality of my neighors
        - the centrality is then a eigen vector
      - Betweenness centrality:
        - how many shortest parths of any two pair of nodes goes through me
      - Closeness centrality:
        - 1/(sum of my shortest distance to all the other nodes)
        - Question: the farest nodes might dominants the sum, deminish the impact of local structure
    - Clustering coefficient:
      - density of edges among my neighor nodes (how my direct friends knows each other)
      - count of triangles - graphlets
    - Graphlets:
      - dispit the same pattern, my location could lead to different graphlets, e.g. in the graphlet, 1 <-> 2 <-> 3, if I am 1 is different from I am 2
      - Graphlet degree vector (GDV)
  - 2.2 Link Prediction Task and Features  [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dVwlE9jYxY&list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn&index=5)
    - Two type of the task
      - Links missing at randim
      - Links over time
    - Link level features:
      - Distance based features
      - Local neighorhood overlap
        - Common neighbors
        - Jaccard's coefficient (IoU)
          - it counts how popular these two nodes are
        - Adamic-Adar index
          - Sometime works very well, it counts how popular the common neighors are:
            $$\sum_{u\in N(v_1)\cap N(v_2)}\frac{1}{\log(k_u)}$$
      - Global neighorhood overlap
        - Why?
          - for two nodes > two hops away, local neighorhood overlap will always = 0
        - Katz index:
          - \# of path of all length between a given two pair
          - Can be calcuated with power of adjencency matrix $A$

  - 2.3 Graph-Level Features and Graph Kernels [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buzsHTa4Hgs&list=PLoROMvodv4rPLKxIpqhjhPgdQy7imNkDn&index=6&ab_channel=StanfordOnline)
    - Kernel methods
      - Graphlet kernel
        - Overall, it is expensive
        - Counting size-$k$ graphlet for a graph with size $n$ taks $n^k$,
        - If a graph's node degree is bounded by $d$, an $O(nd^{k-1})$ alogrithm exists to count all the graphlet
      - Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel
